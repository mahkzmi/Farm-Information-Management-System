# crop_yield_prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a Crop Yield Prediction System that uses historical data and environmental factors (e.g., weather conditions, soil type) to predict crop yields. This system aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts in making data-driven decisions to improve crop productivity.
